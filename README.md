**This game is created with pygame, it integrates a neural network, with two models, p6, has a neural network trained with a database collected from that same game, and p7 has a neural network trained by reinforcement and implements mutations, p8 the The last one so far is the best, since I recreated the code completely from scratch again but this time using OOP in addition to the fact that the AI ​​is trained and developed using pytorch and a genetic algorithm, changing the Q-learning of the p7 and the base of p6 data, all AIs act as opponents in their respective versions, the game is a simple space pong. I will eventually add more features and improvements, technical and visual.**
