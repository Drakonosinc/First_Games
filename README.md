**This game is created with pygame, it integrates a neural network, with three models, p6, has a neural network trained with a database collected from that same game, and p7 has a neural network trained by reinforcement and implements mutations, p8 the last one so far is the best, since I recreated the code completely from scratch but this time using object-oriented programming in addition to the AI ​​​​is trained and developed using pytorch and a genetic algorithm, changing the Q-learning of p7 and the database of p6, in addition to the interface is completely created using pygame removing tkinter used in past versions, all AI act as opponents in their respective versions, the game is a simple space pong. Over time I will add more functions and improvements, both technical and visual.**
